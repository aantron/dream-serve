# dream-serve

**dream-serve** is a [very simple][source] server for static sites. It reloads
your browser when the site changes.

<br>

It's good for [developing docs][odoc], streamlining [coverage reports][bisect],
and so forth. It works by injecting a script into HTML, which opens a WebSocket
back to the server. The server uses the WebSocket to tell the browser when to
reload.

## Usage

```
opam install dream-serve
dream-serve ./my/site
```

<br>

## Based on

dream-serve is implemented as [one small OCaml file][source]. It is based on Web
framework [Dream][dream], [libuv][libuv] binding [Luv][luv], and HTML rewriter
[Lambda Soup][soup].

Special thanks to [Ulrik Strid][ulrikstrid] for writing the
[integration][lwt_luv] between Lwt and Luv/libuv that makes it possible to
easily run Dream over libuv.
